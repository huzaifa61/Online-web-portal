<p>A SCHOOL INFORMATION PORTAL is collection of webpage&rsquo;s which provide users with information and some sort of information about school. Providing information is the major highlight of this project. A person having basic knowledge of suffering on internet can use this portal. <br />The portal can be viewed on devices that have internet connection. Portal helps the user to gain the required information very easily. This website is developed in HTML,CSS,JAVA SCRIPT,BOOTSTRAP. So this made easier to load web pages faster.</p>
<p><br />The school information portal which respond according to the resolution or the screen size automatically are when we access a portal from two different devices with different screen resolution the portal layout is same as for both the devices. <br />This led to poor and slow processing of data and makes it uncomfortable or one two browse in a smaller screen whereas in responsive website the website fit to the screen of the website automatically so no problem acquire for browsing in any kind of the screen size. And as media size change and loading the website becomes much easier.</p>
